Then, we will plot the difference (spread) between the two series, which should look more like a mean-reverting series. To put both series in the same units, we multiply Heating Oil prices (in $/gallon) by 7.25 to convert it to $/millionBTU, the same unit as Natural Gas.  The data for continuous futures (each contract has to be spliced together in a continuous series as contracts expire) was obtained from Quandl.(https://blog.quandl.com/api-for-futures-data)\n"
